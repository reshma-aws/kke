Task: Repace "String" with "Architecture" in root/nautilus.xml in Backup Server

" Login to Backup Server
$ ssh clint@stabkp01
$ sudo su

" Edit the file in vi editor
# vi /root/nautilus.xml

" Replace "String" with "Architecture". Since vi does not show line number activate them first
ESC 
:set number <ENTER>

" Search and replace string from line 1 to last line
:1,832s/String/Architecture/g <ENTER>

or best is to use a command directly from the CLI instead of editing in vi editor

# sed -i 's/String/Architecture/g' /root/nautilus.xml
